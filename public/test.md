## Objective

The goal of this task is to build a custom File Picker, similar to the one below, for a Google Drive connection:

![alt text](<./image (42).png>)

- The functionality should be very similar to the one in your computer to manage your  filesystem (e.g. Finder on MacOS), here are some of the actions you need to perform:
    - Read: read the files and folders from the database that are in the Google Drive connection:
        - Mind that this is like the same functionality as in `ls` in your terminal, meaning, the API is done so that you have to specify which ‚Äúfolder‚Äù you want to read, and list the subsequent files/folders.
    - Delete: the ability to remove a file from the list of files (mind that this technically doesn‚Äôt delete the file in Google Drive, but rather it stops listing it (indexing it)).
    - Create/Update: you do not need to perform these actions
- Now, there is one more thing! The File Picker is meant to be used for picking and INDEXING files to build Knowledge Bases (see API docs below) of a subset of files/folders, and as such, we want the user to be able to:
    - Select a file/folder and index it (see API endpoints in jupyter notebook below).
    - Provide information about whether the file has been indexed or not
    - Allow user to de-index a file (without necessarily deleting the file), and show to the user when the file has been de-index.
- Bonus points:
    - Sorting:
        - By name
        - By date
    - Filtering:
        - By name
    - Searching:
        - By name

## Resources:

- Here is a jupyter notebook for you to see how to use the API endpoints:
    
    [knowledge_base_workflow.ipynb](./test.ipynb)
    
- Credentials to log into Google Drive. You will be asked for the password below inside the jupyter notebook:
    - Email: YYY
    - Password: XXX

These are used for:

- Logging into Google Drive
- Accessing a special account created for this task, with a Google Drive connection already created.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Framework**: Next.js (latest stable version)
- **Data Fetching**: Tanstack Query or [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) + fetch
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (latest stable version)
- **Components library**: [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (ensure compatibility with the latest Next.js version)

## Evaluation Criteria

We will look at the code's quality and the UI/UX's quality.

**Code quality:**

- [SOLID design principles](https://medium.com/byborg-engineering/applying-solid-to-react-ca6d1ff926a4)
- Use of comments wherever necessary
- Proper typing of variables
- React good practices
- Minimizing unnecessary rerenders.
- Next.js good practices

**UI/UX quality:**

- Does everything work as expected? Are there any console errors or broken features?
- Do you have to wait for the UI? Does it make good use of optimistic updates?
- Is it intuitive?
- Does it look visually appealing?
- Any Layout Shift?**:** Measures visual stability, do things move around unexpectedly when interacting with the UI. [Learn more about¬†CLS](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/metrics#cumulative-layout-shift-cls)

## Deliverable

1. **Source Code**: A link to a GitHub repository containing all your source code.
2. **Demo**: A link to a live demo of the page **hosted on Vercel.**
    1. **Demo video**: a screen recording of your design with an explanation of your design choices and thoughts/problem-solving.
    2. **Website link**: to a Vercel-hosted website
3. **Documentation**: A README file that explains your technical choices, how to run the project locally, and any other relevant information.
